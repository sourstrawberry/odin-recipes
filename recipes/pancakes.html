    <ul>
        <li>two cups ap flour</li>
        <li>one teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>one half teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>one teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <li>one cup sour cream</li>
        <li>four tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>for the dry pancake mix: combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt,
            and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until homogenous. transfer to an
            airtight container. good for three months.
        </li>
        <li>for each batch of pancakes: place one batch of dry mix in a large bowl.
            in a medium clean bowl, whisk the eggg whites until stiff peaks form. 
            in a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, buttermilk, and sour cream until homogenous.
            slowly drizzle in the melted butter while whisking. carefully fold in the 
            egg whites with a rubber spatula until just combined. pour the mixture 
            over the dry mix and fold until just combined (there should still be plenty of lumps). 
        </li>
        <li>heat a large heavy-bottomed nonstick skillet over medium heat for five minutes 
            (or use an electric griddle). add a small amount of butter or oil to the griddle 
            and spread with a paper towel until no visible butter or oil remains. use a one-fourth 
            cup dry measure to place four pancakes in the skillet and cook until bubbles start 
            to appear on top and the bottoms are golden brown, about two minutes. 
            carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the second side until golden brown a
            nd completely set, about two minutes longer. serve the pancakes immediately, 
            or keep warm on a wire rack set on a rimmed baking sheet in a warm oven while you 
            cook the remaining three batches. serve with warm maple syrup and butter.
